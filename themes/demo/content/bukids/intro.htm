<div data-testid="richTextElement">

	<p>The sudden spread of a mysterious virus shuts airports and schools down, and Lina is stranded in Davao, after teaching students all over the city. There was no way for her to go back to her native Bohol!</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>But then… she remembers her former student, Aga, her most talented athlete back in high school. The pair meet, and on the way home, Lina and Aga realize there is something they need to do to reverse the effects of this evil virus, and help all their younger pamangkins who couldn’t have fun learning with their friends anymore. Who better to ask for help… than the old HS barkada? So, Lina and Aga end up travelling around the Philippines to round up the crew.</p>
